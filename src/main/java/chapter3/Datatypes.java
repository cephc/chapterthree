    // and byte (1 byte) ((storage requirement))

    //floating-point types are float and double(twice the precision of the float type);Use float values only when
    // working with a library that requires them, or when you need to store a very large number of them; float
    //has a suffix of F. if it doesnt, its considered a double;

    //boolean type has two values-true or false;cannot convert between integers and boolean values;
